                    <p class="causes__heading-text"> Around 100 young people die by suicide every year. Our report investigates the relationship between loneliness and suicide in young people, and if or how they may be connected.</p>
                    <p class="causes__heading-text">We spoke to young people across different parts of Kenya. Most of them told us that their loneliness played a role in causing their suicidal thoughts.</p>
                    <p class="causes__heading-text">Worryingly, many of them said they didn’t feel able to ask for help with loneliness because of the surrounding stigma. And when people did ask for help, it often wasn’t available or suitable for their needs.</p>
                    <p class="causes__heading-text">There is rarely one reason for a person to feel suicidal. Just as with suicide, loneliness is complex – it is a personal experience that's different for every person. Nevertheless, we found that, across the population, there is an association between suicide and loneliness.</p>
                    <p class="causes__heading-text"><strong>What we are doing:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>There is need to listen to what young people are telling us: many of them are struggling with loneliness. Loneliness can be a serious health issue; preventing it could be an important part of suicide prevention.</li>
                        <li>As an organization we have set out ambitious targets across to improve wellbeing in young people, including tackling loneliness.</li>
                        <li>We have different campaigns to tackle stigma that young people are experiencing around loneliness.</li>
