                    <p>This gives you the opportunity to meet others who have lost someone to suicide and share your experiences and feelings.</p>
                    <p><strong>What does it involve?</strong></p>
                    <p>Support groups run weekly for six consecutive weeks and last for 90 minutes with a maximum of eight participants. Groups are free of charge and are run by two trained volunteer facilitators from CSRI.</p>
                    <p><strong>Benefits of attending a  support group</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Understanding: People grieving because of suicide can feel very alone, suffering from a kind of loss they feel others may not understand. Even with supportive family and friends, participants find it helpful to talk with others who have experienced a similar loss.</li>
                        <li>Safety: Participants tell us they feel safe in the group. They’re free to express themselves with others who are also grieving as a result of suicide.</li>
                        <li>Coping: The group supports one another to come to conclusions that often lead to acceptance and increased hope for facing the future. Everyone who has taken part in a group has said they would recommend groups to others.</li>
                        <li>Respect: Participants feel they are listened to in a respectful environment. Even when people are sharing things they may never have said out loud before, there is a non-judgemental and supportive atmosphere.</li>

                    <p>The most important thing is to be there for someone, and to listen. Don’t be scared to make mistakes; the thing people normally need the most is emotional connection.</p>
                    <p>You may have spotted someone’s self-harm rather than them telling you about it. The person you’re talking to could be feeling really vulnerable, with feelings of guilt, shame and isolation.</p>

                        <li><strong>Small Talk saves lives:</strong> A simple question or observation can be all it takes to interrupt someone’s suicidial thoughts and could help set them</li>
                        <li><strong>Real people, real stories:</strong> Real stories from men who have been through tough times, encouraging other men to seek help.</li>
                        <li><strong>Saving lives cant wait:</strong> Every year, thousands of people die from suicide in Kenya. Government action could help save many of these lives This is unacceptable. Saving lives can't wait: the time for action is now.</li>
                        <li>We must commit to reaching the lowest national suicide rate ever recorded. Anything less would be accepting failure. No more half-measures. No more compromises. No more underfunding. Together, we have the power to demand the Government takes action that matches the scale of the problem.</li>
                        <li><strong>Talk to us:</strong> Write us an <a href="">email, text, whatsapp, call us</a></li>
