                            Centre for suicide research and intervention (CSRI) develops comprehensive and integrated approaches to reducing life loss and effects on the society from suicide and suicidal behaviors in the country and beyond.
                        </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>We strive to promote and provide direction to efforts to modify the social infrastructure in ways that will affect attitudes about suicide in our educational sectors, social service, and health care systems.</p>
                    <p>As a Not for profit organization we focus on developing evidence-based community initiatives that will lead to a better outcome for individuals at risk of suicide, including their social support systems (friends and families) and the wider community.</p>
                    <p>
                        By engaging experts in suicide prevention and other mental health professionals, our desire is to   define and prioritize programs and models that will contribute to reduction in suicide rates. Our model is geared towards:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Engaging in research that will contribute to knowledge and learning on suicide prevention</li>
                        <li>Better predictions and detection to create safety nets for people at risk</li>
                        <li>Delivering targeted postvention and interventions at the right time and at the right place.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        Our results will be achieved by redesigning suicide care systems and developing models of care to those affected in one way or another by suicidal behavior.
                        Specifically: Suicide-Informed care as it reduces cases of suicide as individuals will be handled by people who understand the prevalence of triggers and its impact and also recognize the signs and symptoms of suicide ideation.

                    <p>
                        Creating an emotionally and physically safe space, and empowering the individuals with an active voice in collaborative decision-making; and respecting the person’s experience through active listening, being sensitive to the language used, being transparent, being trustworthy, and offering stability and consistency incorporating practices that promote a culture of safety, empowerment, and healing.
